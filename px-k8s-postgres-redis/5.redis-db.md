In this step, we will initialize some sample data in our redis instance.

### Step: Setup NodeJS and load some data

```
nvm install v8.11.0
npm install
npm start
```{{execute T1}}

You should see trace output as the data is loaded through our node.js app

### Examine the data

View the existing keys below:

```
redis-cli -h $REDISHOST keys '*'
```{{execute T1}}
