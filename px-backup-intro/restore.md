Now, let's restore the application. 

First, let's delete the app. This will delete the entire app and PVCs.

`kubectl delete ns demo`{{execute}}

After the delete completed, head over the app and check it is not available.

Next, head over to the backup UI and find your backup.

https://[[HOST2_SUBDOMAIN]]-31234-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com

Select the backup using the right three dots and click restore.

1. Give your restore a name.
2. Select the only cluster in the list.
3. Select `Replace existing resources`

Verify your backup has completed by waiting for the application to come back online and see your data is recovered. Note, it can take up to 5 minutes for the UI to come back on Katacoda.
