[Portworx](https://portworx.com/) is a software defined persistent storage solution designed and purpose built for applications deployed as containers, via container orchestrators such as Kubernetes, Marathon and Swarm. It is a clustered block storage solution and provides a Cloud-Native layer from which containerized stateful applications programmatically consume block, file and object storage services directly through the scheduler.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy Cassandra to Kubernetes and use Portworx Volumes to provide HA capability:
* Use the Portworx Storage Class to create a PVC with 3 replicas of the data
* Use a simple YAML file to deploy Cassandra using this storage class
* How to validate data persistence by deleting the Cassandra pod

### High Level Overview

First we will deploy Cassandra in a stateful set with only a single node (replicas=1) to show the basics of node failover. We will create some data, force Cassandra to flush the data to disk, and then failover the Cassandra pod and show how it comes back up with it's data intact.

Then, we're going to show how we can scale the cluster to 3 nodes and dynamically create volumes for each.

Finally, we're going to show how we can take a consistent snapshot of the three node Cassandra cluster and restore the cluster after a database table drop operation, recovering the data.
